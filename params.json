A simple list of commands (and their syntax) can be found by typying \"help\" at the Console window of the debugger. !UCDebug runs in a Raspberry Pi 1B+ under version 5.24 of RISC OS (released on 16-April-2018). A working copy of the application is provided for ease of use, as well as the full code. !UCDebug requires GCC4, OSLib and C shared libraries in order to compile. More information can be found in the README file in the code.\r\n\r\n!UCDebug is distributed under the GPLv3 license.\r\n\r\n##Debugger description\r\n\r\nWe intend to upload full documentation and a comprehensive use guide very soon.\r\n\r\n##Developers and maintainers\r\n\r\n!UCDebug has been co-developed by [Cristóbal Camarero](http://personales.unican.es/camareroc/), Fernando Vallejo and [Pablo Fuentes](http://personales.unican.es/fuentesp/), as part of a project led by Carmen Martínez. Other current and former members of the group who have also collaborated include Jesús Gutiérrez, Elena Suárez and Adrián Barredo.\r\n\r\n#Known Bugs (v1.3)\r\n\r\n* Execution of code in privileged modes not supported (system may freeze).\r\n* Loading files without code sections may reset the memory view window to address 0x00000000.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
